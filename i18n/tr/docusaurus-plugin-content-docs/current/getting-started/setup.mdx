# Setup ProBot 

:::info

In order to invite ProBot to your server, certain permissions are required. Without these, the bot cannot be added to your server. These permissions are:

- `Administrator` Permission 
- `Manage Servers` Permission

:::

## Step 1: Inviting ProBot

Use the [invite link](https://probot.io/invite) to invite ProBot to your server and authorize your account, selecting your server.

## Step 2: Authorizing and Granting Permissions

Upon inviting ProBot, you will be prompted to authorize your account and select the necessary permissions for the bot to function properly.

## Step 3: Setting ProBot's Role

To display server roles in some dashboard modules, move ProBot's role to the top of the server roles hierarchy. To do this:
- Go to server settings 
- Click on roles
- Hold-click and drag ProBot's role to the top of the list

:::caution

Discord may not always display the roles on the dashboard, even after dragging ProBot's role to the top. If this happens, try these steps:
1. Drag ProBot's role downward 
2. Save the changes
3. Drag ProBot's role upward
4. Save the changes again
