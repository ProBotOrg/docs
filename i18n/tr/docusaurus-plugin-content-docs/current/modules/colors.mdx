# Color Feature: How to Create Custom Roles for Your Discord Server

The color feature in Discord allows server owners to create unique, numbered color roles for members to choose from, which can help to enhance the appearance and engagement of a server. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to setting up the color feature, as well as information on how to customize the title, icon shape, and background image.

## Setting up the Color Feature

Setting up the color feature is easy and straightforward. All you need to do is create numbered named roles such as `1, 2, 3, 4`, and so on, without any additional text. Once you have done this, the bot will automatically detect these roles as color options. Members can then select a color role to customize their name color and distinguish themselves in the server.

## Color List Title 

Customizing the title of the color list is an effective way to personalize your server's appearance. To change the title, you need to access the configuration panel and insert the desired text into the `Color List Title` field. By doing this, you can make the title match your server's branding or theme.

## Color Icon Shape

Another way to personalize your server's appearance is by customizing the shape of the color icons. You can choose between a square or circle shape for the color icons. To change the shape, go to the configuration panel and select the desired option.

## Image Background

Customizing the background image of the color feature is another way to make your server stand out. You can choose to have a transparent background or upload a custom image that matches your server's branding or theme. To upload a custom image, select the option for `Custom Image` in the configuration panel and then insert or upload the desired image. 

To ensure that the color feature works smoothly, it's essential to keep the following points in mind:

:::caution

- Users can only have one color role at a time. Choosing a different color will remove the previous one. To reset the color, enter the number `0` in the option.
- The bot's role must be above the color roles in the server's hierarchy. This ensures that the bot can modify member roles as required.
- Keep in mind that the background image must be less than 3MB due to restrictions.
