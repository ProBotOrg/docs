## Set up

Once you have accessed the Auto-Roles module, you can begin configuring the roles that will be automatically assigned to new users. To do this, use the module's select menu to choose one or multiple roles as desired.

## Premium Auto-Role

You can set a unique link for auto and particular roles if you are a premium subscriber.

1. Select `Add`
2. Then, click the `Edit` button.
3. Insert the invitation link
4. Select the roles you'd like members to have if they join through this invite link.

1. The bot's role must be higher than the auto-role chosen.
2. If the Discord rule-screen panel is enabled, newly-joined users will be required to accept the rules before receiving the auto role.
3. The bot will not assign users roles with administrative privileges.
