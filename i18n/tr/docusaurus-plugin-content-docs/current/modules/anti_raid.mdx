# Anti-Raid

:::caution

This feature is only available for `Tier 1 and Tier 2` subscribers.

:::

The anti-raid feature of ProBot allows you to protect your server from unwanted raiders. With this feature, you can set up a system that automatically detects and takes action against raiders based on your desired configuration.

:::info

The dashboard is where the configurations described here are managed.

1. Go to the dashboard and log in. 
2. Select your server from the menu on the left.
3. Choose the module and make sure that it is enabled. 

:::

## Account Age

The minimum Discord account age for detection and action against raiders. Four options are available:

> **1 Week**: ProBot will detect accounts less or equal to one week and take action against them.

> **1 Month**: ProBot will detect accounts less or equal to one month and take action against them.

> **3 Months**: ProBot will detect accounts less or equal to three months and take action against them.

> **None**: This option will detect all account ages, regardless of how long the account has existed.


## List Length

The number of people that must join for ProBot to start an anti-raid. This can be set between 5 and 100.

## Time To Fill The List (Seconds)

The time frame within which ProBot will detect users joining. With this option, you can set how much time raiders have to join before ProBot starts taking action.

:::info How It Works

As an example, if you set the account age to `1 Week`, the list length to `5`, and the time in seconds to `5`, the anti-raid system will start as soon as `5` users with an account age of `1 week` join within `5` seconds. This means that if `5` users join your server within `5` seconds and they all have accounts that are less than or equal to one week old, ProBot will start taking action against them.

:::

## Action To Take

The action ProBot will take against raiders. Three options are available:

1. **None**: ProBot will take no action.
2. **Mute**: ProBot will mute the raider.
3. **Ban**: ProBot will ban the raider.

If ban or mute is selected, you will have the option to specify the duration of the action in hours, days, and months.

## Disable Welcome During Raid

You can enable this option to prevent the welcome message from being spammed by raiders.

## Send A Message To A Channel

ProBot can keep you updated on the start and end of a raid by sending a message to a channel. You can customize the message for the start and end of a raid as desired. This allows you to keep track of when raids are happening on your server.
