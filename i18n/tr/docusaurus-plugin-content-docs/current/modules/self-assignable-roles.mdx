# Reaction

Members receive a role when they click on a reaction in traditional reaction roles.

1. Select `Reaction` from the drop-down menu.
2. Select `Add Emoji` from the drop-down menu.
3. Select whether you want to add a normal or a gif emoji.
4. Create a role for that reaction using the plus `+` sign.

:::caution

If your server roles do not appear in the dashboard, move the ProBot's role higher in the server roles hierarchy.

:::

# Role Mode

You will have several mode options for the reaction role.

:::caution

The mode will apply to all of the options in that message.

:::

## Toggle Mode

This mode adds or removes roles based on whether the user has the roles or not. `Recommended`

## Give Mode

This mode adds roles whenever a reaction/interaction is added or removed. 'Excellent for accepting rules!'


## Take Mode

This mode will remove roles whenever a reaction/interaction is added or removed.

# Type of Notification

You will have two options for managing the notification type, whether you want it to respond to user interaction or keep it quiet: no bell:

## Notify Type

This option will send a reply message that can only be seen by the user who interacted with the interaction as they add, remove, or make no changes to the roles to keep them tuned.

1. The first option is the reply message when the role is added.
2. The second option is the reply message when the role is removed.
3. The third option is when no changes have been made to the user roles.

:::info

To have the bot mention the role, include `{0}` in the reply message, as it refers to the role.

:::

## Silent Type

If you want to keep things quiet without drawing the user's attention to any reply messages from the bot, this option is for you because it will not display any reply messages.


# Important Notes

:::warning

The reaction may break if you have select menus or buttons in the background but aren't using them; to resolve this issue, you need to delete any select menu and button options that you may have added on the same message but aren't using.

:::

:::warning

You are not allowed to link multiple messages with self-assignable roles to the same embedded message because doing so may cause problems.

:::

:::info

You need to subscribe to the `Premium Tier 1/2` tier to set multiple roles for the same option.
