# Premium Bot Information

Welcome to the information page for our premium bots. On this page, you will find a comprehensive explanation of our premium bot process, including the available features, premium tiers, payment methods, and frequently asked questions.

## Premium Tiers

Our premium plan is designed for server owners who want to enhance their servers with advanced features and protection against raiders and vandals. Our premium service offers two unique tiers, each with its own set of features.

## Premium Tier 1

The first tier is perfect for medium-sized servers that require multiple functions at an affordable cost. The features included in this tier are:

- [Protection](/modules/vip_protection.mdx)
- [Temporary Link](/modules/temp_link.mdx) 
- [Voice Online](/modules/voice_online.mdx)
- [Auto-Role for Specific Invite Link](/modules/auto_role.mdx)

:::caution

Please note that you cannot change the bot preferences, and the invite link cannot be edited.

## Premium Tier 2

The second tier is ideal for larger servers and includes all the features from Premium Tier 1, as well as:

- [Anti-Raid](/modules/anti_raid.mdx)
- Personalized Bot, including a custom username, avatar, status, and exclusive commands.

Please note that you cannot use an optional bot token with this tier.

## Managing Your Premium Bot

You can manage your premium bot from a dedicated page. The management options for each tier are as follows:

- **Premium Tier 1**: You can edit the payment cycle, invite the bot, and renew it using your preferred payment method.

- **Premium Tier 2**: You can edit the bot's presence, username, avatar, and status, and invite the bot and renew it just like with Tier 1. Additionally, you will have a unique bot number that you can use for special needs.

## Inviting Your Premium Bot

To access the premium features, you must invite the bot to your server. The inviting process can be completed through the Manage Premium page, which can be accessed through this [Manage Premium](https://probot.io/premium/manage).

In the rare instance that premium features remain locked after inviting the bot, try kicking the premium bot or both the premium and standard bots and then re-inviting the premium bot to your server. You can remove the standard bot after purchasing the premium version.
