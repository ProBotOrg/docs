## Setup
 
Before you can begin creating responses, you must first click the Add Response button. This will open up the configuration options for the Auto Responder, allowing you to set up your triggers and responses.

## Trigger

The trigger is the key phrase or word that will activate the bot's response. This can be anything you'd like, and you have the option to set a wildcard, which will allow the bot to detect the trigger whether it is in a complete sentence or a single word

## Wildcard 

Let the bot detect the trigger, whether it is in a complete sentence or a single word.

## Send as a Reply

You can use the discord reply option for the bot's response to the trigger. This means that the bot will reply directly to the message that contains the trigger, making it clear that the response is automated.

## Ping The Author

You can also allow the bot to ping the user through the reply option. This means that the user's name will be included in the bot's response, alerting them to the reply.

## Response

The text you wish to receive in response to the trigger. This can have unique variables, which are displayed beneath the text box. You can also add an unbounded number of random responses, each with its response text.

## Random Responses

An unbounded number of random responses that can be added, each with its response text. This will make the bot's response more varied and interesting.

:::caution

It's important to note that once the trigger has been set, it cannot be altered. So, it's crucial to be mindful and cautious when configuring your triggers to avoid any confusion or errors.
